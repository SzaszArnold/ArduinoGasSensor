# Arduino project - C/C++ language

The system watching the sensor value, if the value is greater than the threshold generate an alert, send the alert to the user using a web server and sends a signal to the gas shut-off system. The user can read the current gas concentration in real time, and can interrupt the system manually.

I worked with:

ESP32 microcontroller
MQ-2 gas sensor
ESP32 web server
